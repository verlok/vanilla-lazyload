# TODO

## In progress

-   Release everything as v15

## What's next

-   Add `data-bg-2x` support
-   Should I add a `resetStatus` method (static for a single image, not static to affect all the lazy images) to help whose just update the data-src attributes and want to lazy load again?

## Test

-   Test more modules and functions, coverage!!!
-   Test native `img`, native `iframe`, alone or in conjunction with `video`s.

Test more modules

-   [ ] autoinitialize
-   [ ] purge
-   [ ] reveal
